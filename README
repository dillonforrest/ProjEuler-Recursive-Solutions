My solutions to Project Euler problems.  I use only python and functional programming.  Recursion is one of my biggest programming weaknesses.  Hopefully with this practice, that won't be the case for long.  :)

The numbers in the file names directly correspond with the Project Euler problem of the same number.  www.projecteuler.net
